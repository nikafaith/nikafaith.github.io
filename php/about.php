            <p id="biotitle">Let me tell you <span>about me.</span></p>
            <p>I'm a UX Designer & Researcher born and raised in sunny San Diego, California. I'm currently majoring in Information Science at Cornell University with a triple concentration in UX, Design Culture & Production, and Data Science with a minor in Business. </p>
            <p>I believe that we must use design to reflect how we view the world. By doing this, we can create beautiful, yet straightforward interfaces that afford enjoyable user experiences.</p>
            <p>With technology and social media's growing prevalence in the world, I strongly hold that we must understand their effects on our society. My work with the Social Media Lab has allowed me to explore my curiosities: the complex issue of cyberbullying, how different generations perceive technology and social media, as well as how technology affects relationships, to name a few.</p>
            <p>When I'm not designing or researching, you can find me doodling in my bullet journal, practicing hand lettering, playing rugby, or making a mean cappuccino.</p>
