            <p>I had the pleasure of staying in San Diego for the summer as an intern for Petco Inc.s' eCommerce analytics team as a tag management intern.</p>
            <p>My responsibilties included:
                <ul>
                    <li>creating daily eCommerce business reports</li>
                    <li>compiling weekly eCommerce business reports to be used by employees in the WBR</li>
                    <li>carrying out an exhaustive audit of all tags present and data collected on the eCommerce site</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>I had shared with my mentor and manager that I was interested in web development, so I was given the opportunity to assist the Digital Production team in coding pages for the responsive redesign of the eCommerce site.</p>
            <p>During my internship, Petco had experienced a leak of PII data into their URLs via a Google Marketing tag, which I had remedied with my mentor in close collaboration with the IT team.</p>
